* Difficulties
I have made multiple repositories for this and finally put a clean one together to turn this is in. I had trouble finding a way to make the code clean and not really repetetive with the questions and answers in JS. I was able to find quite a bit of code to reference online and used multiple sources to put together one that worked. This code I feel is not completely mine but I did follow along with it a lot to try to make sure I understood what was being used and why, and in result, figured out why a lot of the code I tried to make did not work in the long run.
